// TEMPORARY PASSWORDS for accounts an admin creates (Day 18).
//
// The admin is shown it ONCE, to hand over in person or on WhatsApp. It is
// never emailed (an inbox is a poor place to keep a password) and never
// stored: only its argon2id hash goes into the database, like any password.
// Its owner must replace it at first sign-in (users.must_change_password),
// so the admin doesn't keep knowing it.

// About 250 short, common, easy-to-say words: each word picked at random
// adds almost 8 bits. Easy to read aloud over the phone without spelling.

 * Three random words and four digits, e.g. "mango-river-slate-4821".

 * randomInt() uses the operating system's cryptographic random generator
 * (never Math.random(), whose output can be predicted). Three words from
 * this list and four digits give about 2^37 possibilities. That is plenty
 * for a password that is rate-limited at login and must be replaced at the
 * first sign-in.
